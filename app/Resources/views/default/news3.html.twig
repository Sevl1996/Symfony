        Manchester United have joined an elite band of teams to have won all three of UEFA's major club competitions after beating Ajax 2-0 in the UEFA Europa League final to collect the one trophy missing from their collection of major European honours.<br>

        Their first came in <font style="color:#1e90ff;">1967/68</font>, when Sir Matt Busby led a team featuring George Best and Sir Bobby Charlton to European Champion Clubs' Cup glory, which they experienced again under Sir Alex Ferguson in <font style="color:#1e90ff;">1998/99</font> and <font style="color:#1e90ff;">2007/08</font> â€“ the Scot having also steered the club to European Cup Winners' Cup success in 1990/91.<br>

        Only four sides have lifted each of the European Champion Clubs' Cup, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League and European Cup Winners' Cup. UEFA.com recounts that proud quartet's distinguished record.<br>
